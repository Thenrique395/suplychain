# Supply Chain Portal - .NET 8 + Angular (Full Starter)

This expanded starter implements points 1-7 requested:
1. Automatic EF Core migrations on startup (Postgres)
2. FluentValidation for DTOs
3. Enhanced EmployeesController (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Pagination, Search)
4. Unit tests (xUnit + InMemory EF Core)
5. Angular frontend with Create/Edit forms, routing, and JWT interceptor
6. Switched DB to Postgres in docker-compose
7. Polished README and scripts

## Run with Docker (recommended)
Make sure Docker is running, then:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- API: http://localhost:5000
- Swagger: http://localhost:5000/swagger
- Frontend (Angular dev server): http://localhost:4200

## Notes
- The Angular folder contains a minimal Angular app (not generated by Angular CLI). For local development, you may prefer to `ng new` and copy the components.
- The API will apply pending EF migrations automatically on startup via `db.Database.Migrate()`.

## Testing
To run unit tests (requires .NET SDK):
```bash
dotnet test tests/Api.Tests
```
